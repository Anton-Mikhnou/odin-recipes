    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Lasagna</strong> is a traditional Italian dish that is loved by many people around the world. It is a type of pasta dish made with stacked layers of wide and flat pasta sheets, typically alternating with various fillings and sauces. The dish is then baked in the oven until the pasta is cooked and the flavors have melded together. The key ingredients in lasagna include pasta sheets, a meat or vegetable filling, cheese, and a tomato-based sauce. The pasta sheets used in lasagna are typically made from wheat flour and eggs, although there are also variations that use no-boil or precooked sheets for convenience.</p>
